			<h3>Backstory</h3>

			<p>
				I have always loved basketball I played it, met lots of people people, and traveled many places because of it. But nothing compares to being able to watch the Lakers play in the 2015-2016 season because I got to see one of Kobe's last games. Which you can see from the picture little me standing in front of a Kareem Abdul-Jabbar statue outside the stadium. So with all that in mind for this project something that has happend to me is I would remember an NBA player but not everything about them. So with this app its all in one website to find any player you think of. I came about this idea because of another passion of mine Pokemon which has the Pokedex to find any pokemon. So by putting the two together I made an NBA version of the Pokedex where instead of finding Pokemon you find NBA players easily.
